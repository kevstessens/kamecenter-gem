    $ bundle install

## Usage

###Posting an achievement

	Kamecenter.post_achievement("game_id","achievement_id","uid","secret_key")

		response.state => Returns the state of the operation
			- 10: SUCCESS
			- 20: INCORRECT SIGNATURE
			- 30: ALREADY ADDED
		response.message => Returns a message (like "Incorrect signature!")

###Getting data from a user

	Kamecenter.get_user_data("game_id","uid","secret_key")

	It returns a User object,with a uid, a name, and a list of achievements. Each achievement has points, id, and name
